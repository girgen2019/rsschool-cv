## Briefly About Myself:
I am interested in web development because it is an opportunity for my development as a specialist, personality and an example of how you can change and develop your professional life. Web development offers limitless opportunities for professional growth, with many free, high-quality self-education resources and a large developer community.

I am purposeful and easy to learn. I am ready to bring any business to an effective result. I easily maintain business and professional contacts.

I believe in myself and in my ability to learn and acquire new skills that will guide me along this path and become an experienced front-end developer.
